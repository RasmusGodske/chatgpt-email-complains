# Welcome to the "ChatGPT Email Complaints" Git repository!

This repository contains a Python script called main.py that sends an email to the OpenAI support team every day, and makes the tone of the email increasingly frustrated over time. Why, you may ask? Well, it's simple - the OpenAI support team stopped responding to me, so I decided to take matters into my own hands!

Feel free to modify this script for your own future needs, and have fun with it!
